Software Engineer,$89K-$175K (Glassdoor est.),"At Kin, we’re looking for self-motivated thinkers ready to make a change for our customers. We value tackling challenges and breaking down walls – but being chill about it.

Kin Insurance is an insurtech startup that sells affordable, user-friendly homeowners insurance. Unlike many startups that gather users and figure out how to be profitable later, we are selling a product that homeowners need and depend on now. We’re innovating in an industry largely untouched by tech, so we are always thinking big.

We believe autonomy is key to job satisfaction, which is why we say the person closest to the problem should solve it. It’s also why we offer unlimited vacation time: we trust in our team to manage their own projects and time. If you want the chance to develop your skills, work with some of the best minds in the industry, and see what you’re really capable of, come learn and grow with us.

About the Development Team

You’ll be part of a growing company and a growing but lean development team. In practice, that means you’ll have the support you need to get your work done, but you’ll also have to be familiar with the whole code base and all of our products and services. Our team is business-minded, so everyone has good working knowledge about the company, fundraising, and the insurance industry. The dev team is also cross-functional, so you’ll work with our insurance experts, quality assurance, product team, and operations very closely.

We’re very product-focused and don’t let tech fads get in the way of shipping new features—but we also value clean code, automated testing, and other sustainable practices.

In short: we move fast, are excited about the work we do, and don’t let non-essentials get in the way of building great products.

So, What’s the Role?

You will collaborate daily with various members of our development team, creating and modifying software to improve our customers’ experience. Our main goal at Kin is to make insurance accessible and affordable, and much of this stems from innovation and efficiency.

A Day in the Life May Include:
Writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code in Ruby on Rails (with some Javascript and Python)
Collaborating with various members of the development team to complete multiple projects. We’re a startup, so we’ll keep you busy
Providing subject matter expertise and support.

I’ve Got Skills, But Do I Have the Necessary Ones?

You might be a good fit if you are:
Comfortable in a startup environment – we’re fast-paced, self-motivated, and determined to change the industry
A fast learner, ready to bring previous knowledge to this position and continue developing along the way
A professional developer with a minimum of 3 years of previous experience
Experienced with designing Ruby, Python, or Node applications
Familiar with fintech – a plus, but not required.

About Cleverific

What's it like to work in engineering at Cleverific?

Inclusive culture. Our customers come from all backgrounds, from all around the world. We're committed to building an actively inclusive and progressive work environment that makes Cleverific an excellent home for everyone.

Ownership. Engineers are involved early in project planning and own projects from end-to-end. Rather than participate in tedious planning and estimate exercises, you'll learn about the full context of the project and take ownership for ensuring that the work gets done. You'll be expected to take responsibilities for the stated priorities of your projects while keeping in mind the needs of the team beyond your own role.

Focus time. We hate meetings. On most days, our office is just a nice quiet place with minimal interruptions so you can focus on getting your best work done and collaborate with whoever you need to.

Ship first. We ship prototypes as early as possible. We favor working software in any state over status reports and gantt charts.

Cleverific is a fully bootstrapped, profitable software company with no plans to take venture capital. This is a deliberate choice that allows us to make decisions in our best interests and our customers’ best interests. We'll never have to worry about fundraising rounds or the whims of a VC-packed board of directors. But this doesn’t mean we’re not ambitious. Our revenue doubled last year and we’re aiming to more than double again this year. You’ll fit right in with us if you want to be part of this kind of growth.

We’re committed generalists, eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. Our workplace and our benefits are designed to support a sustainable, healthy relationship with your work.

Work-life balance. You'll work no more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis so you'll have time to pursue your other interests and responsibilities outside of work.

Unlimited PTO. We don't have any rules or accruals for how much time you can take per year. You're encouraged take regular vacations after important deadlines to come back refreshed, with new ideas and enthusiasm.

9x9 schedule. We take every other Friday off to take advantage of our lives in beautiful, sunny Santa Barbara. We use these days for personal appointments, sleeping in, wine tasting, long workouts, anything—it's a bonafide day off. Some of us still choose to work on select projects that are otherwise hard to prioritize.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world-changing? Be you, with us!",4.1,"Cisco Systems - Engineering - Software

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Who are we?

We’re FarApp, a rapidly growing e-commerce automation solution company. It sounds like a lot of buzz words, but we really are growing fast and want to bring in new talented folks to help manage our rapidly expanding customer base. We hope that we can find that talent in you!

FarApp is a SAAS company who has been in business for over 15 years. In those 15 years, we’ve expanded our original codebase to over 1.5 million lines of code processing millions of operations a day. We connect to over 60 endpoints to help our customers become versatile e-commerce participants.

What will you be doing?

You’ll be diving into our code and figuring out ways to permanently solve problems that our customers either create or point out. This requires that you have a comfort with reading code in the context of a larger system without fear and that you're willing to try out and test solutions. You need to be comfortable deploying code 10 times a day into a live environment as you solve real-world problems.

You’ll also be helping to expand our product line. We add new endpoints to our service all the time, meaning that we must develop new connectors to integrate within our current system. That could mean something simple like a new logistics company, or it could be a new marketplace that has popped up that people are flocking to.

You’ll also be participating in our continuing effort to reduce our integration time. Currently, we have an average integration time for new customers of 40 days. We strongly believe we can reduce that to less than a day, maybe less than a couple of hours. We need your creative, intelligent ideas and initiative to make that happen.

We're looking for somebody who is passionate about software and is interested to start at the ground level with a company so that they can help it grow and share in its success. We hope that you're excited to make a big impact because you'll have plenty of opportunities to do that. We don't need somebody with a lot of experience but just need somebody who can learn new technologies quickly and is excited to make learning part of their regular routine.

Cool things:

Competitive salary with great benefits

Working from home! We’re evil and make you work from home two days a week!

We offer health, dental and vision plans.

We have a 401k plan.

Bi-monthly catered lunches and office snacks.

Bi-annual raises and performance-based bonuses.

Monthly company outings

Things you need (requirements):
BS Degree in Computer Science or related field
Knowledge in Python, Flask, TurboGears, AngularJS is a plus
Experience with eCommerce marketplaces and/or platforms and APIs is a plus

Kin Insurance is an insurtech startup that sells affordable, user-friendly homeowners insurance. Unlike many startups that gather users and figure out how to be profitable later, we are selling a product that homeowners need and depend on now. We’re innovating in an industry largely untouched by tech, so we are always thinking big.

We believe autonomy is key to job satisfaction, which is why we say the person closest to the problem should solve it. It’s also why we offer unlimited vacation time: we trust in our team to manage their own projects and time. If you want the chance to develop your skills, work with some of the best minds in the industry, and see what you’re really capable of, come learn and grow with us.

About the Development Team

You’ll be part of a growing company and a growing but lean development team.

So, What’s the Role?

You will collaborate daily with various members of our development team, creating and modifying software to improve our customers’ experience. Our main goal at Kin is to make insurance accessible and affordable, and much of this stems from innovation and efficiency.

Writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code in Ruby on Rails (with some Javascript and Python)
Collaborating with various members of the development team to complete multiple projects. We’re a startup, so we’ll keep you busy

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.

Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.

Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points.

It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Who are we?

We’re FarApp, a rapidly growing e-commerce automation solution company. It sounds like a lot of buzz words, but we really are growing fast and want to bring in new talented folks to help manage our rapidly expanding customer base. We hope that we can find that talent in you!

FarApp is a SAAS company who has been in business for over 15 years. In those 15 years, we’ve expanded our original codebase to over 1.5 million lines of code processing millions of operations a day. We connect to over 60 endpoints to help our customers become versatile e-commerce participants.

What will you be doing?

You’ll be diving into our code and figuring out ways to permanently solve problems that our customers either create or point out. This requires that you have a comfort with reading code in the context of a larger system without fear and that you're willing to try out and test solutions. You need to be comfortable deploying code 10 times a day into a live environment as you solve real-world problems.

You’ll also be helping to expand our product line. We add new endpoints to our service all the time, meaning that we must develop new connectors to integrate within our current system. That could mean something simple like a new logistics company, or it could be a new marketplace that has popped up that people are flocking to.

You’ll also be participating in our continuing effort to reduce our integration time. Currently, we have an average integration time for new customers of 40 days. We strongly believe we can reduce that to less than a day, maybe less than a couple of hours. We need your creative, intelligent ideas and initiative to make that happen.

We're looking for somebody who is passionate about software and is interested to start at the ground level with a company so that they can help it grow and share in its success. We hope that you're excited to make a big impact because you'll have plenty of opportunities to do that. We don't need somebody with a lot of experience but just need somebody who can learn new technologies quickly and is excited to make learning part of their regular routine.

Cool things:

Competitive salary with great benefits

Working from home! We’re evil and make you work from home two days a week!

We offer health, dental and vision plans.

We have a 401k plan.

Bi-monthly catered lunches and office snacks.

Bi-annual raises and performance-based bonuses.

Monthly company outings

Things you need (requirements):
BS Degree in Computer Science or related field
Knowledge in Python, Flask, TurboGears, AngularJS is a plus
Experience with eCommerce marketplaces and/or platforms and APIs is a plus
We're recruiting for applicants at levels of experience who are passionate about solving problems.

Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
